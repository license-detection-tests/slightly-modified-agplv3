This copy of the AGPLv3 has had its header levels modified. Instead of the top header being an h3, it was made an h1,
and all other section headers were modified accordingly.
Additionally, in the "How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs" section, the copyright header was changed 
to use a backtick-delimited codeblock rather than an indented one.
